#SupportStreamliner


This is a nifty little tool build in order to help the team avoid performing repetitive tasks (i.e. executing the same command in 10+ servers), it is built using python and fabric,

This makes use of an xml file that contains the connection information for the servers, due to security reasons i am not uploading it,

Best Regards,
